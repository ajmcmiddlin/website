title: About
---

After being scarred by bad web development experiences, I am learning to build
and maintain reliable systems through functional programming, reproducibility,
and automation.  I'm currently serversitting for an e-fashion company based in
Singapore. Have a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar)
or [my résumé](/resume) for more details.

If you'd like to get in touch, find me on [my favourite echo
chamber](https://twitter.com/vsagar2109) or shoot me an email at
`$THIS_DOMAIN`@gmail.com.
