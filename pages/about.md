I am learning to build and maintain robust systems through functional
programming, reproducibility, and automation. Have a look at my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar) and [résumé](/resume) for more
details.

If you'd like to get in touch, find me on [my favourite echo
chamber](https://twitter.com/vbhvsgr) or send me an email at the address listed
in my résumé.
