It is custom for Recurse Center attendees to write a reflective blog post at
the conclusion of their batch. I've been trying on and off to write mine since
my batch ended a year and a half ago, but instead of reflection, which I am
terrible at, I thought I would instead share a few anecdotes about my time at
RC and what I learned from them.

- Jobs chat + visa situation
- IHaskell + Libby, attoparsec + Alan
- Dry ice + Birthday Cake
- Speaking at NYHUG + Hack && Tell(?)
- Coming back and hanging out at RC as an alum
