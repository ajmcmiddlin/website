The section of the Nixpkgs manual that talks about [creating statically linked
binaries](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#creating-statically-linked-binaries)
with Haskell ends with the caveat:

> Itâ€™s important to realize, however, that most system libraries in Nix are built as shared libraries only, i.e. there is just no static library available that Cabal could link!

That sounds like a challenge.

On other platforms, building a static binary is meant to be as simple as

```bash
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal configure --disable-executable-dynamic --ghc-option=-optl=-static --ghc-option=-optl=-pthread
$ cabal build
```

with the magic happening in the second step. On Nix, we do in fact have the
necessary static libraries and we can provide them as build inputs but keeping
track of the library paths gets hairy quickly. Fortunately Nix has an escape
hatch called `buildFHSUserEnv` that we can use to simulate an environment that
`cabal` is more familiar with.

Let's put it through its paces by building a simple Scotty web app:

```haskell
name:                blank-me-up
version:             0.1.0.0
license:             BSD3
build-type:          Simple
cabal-version:       >=1.10

executable blank-me-up
  main-is:             Main.hs
  build-depends:       base >=4.9 && <5
                     , scotty
  default-language:    Haskell2010
```
*blank-me-up.cabal*

```haskell
 {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Web.Scotty

import Data.Monoid (mconcat)

main = scotty 3000 $ do
    get "/:word" $ do
        beam <- param "word"
        html $ mconcat ["<h1>Scotty, ", beam, " me up!</h1>"]
```
*Main.hs*

We create `default.nix`:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
in pkgs.buildFHSUserEnv {
  name = "fhs";
  targetPkgs = pkgs: [
    (pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (p: with p; [ cabal-install ]))
    pkgs.gmp5.static
    pkgs.glibc.static
    pkgs.zlib.static
    pkgs.zlib.dev
  ];
}
```
*default.nix*

This defines a chroot where statically linked versions of `gmp`, `glibc`, and
`zlib` are available, as well as `zlib.h`. We enter this environment by running

```bash
$ $(nix-build)/bin/fhs
```

and then we can run the commands above with only slight modifications:

```bash
$ cabal install --only-dependencies --extra-include-dirs=/usr/include --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/lib
$ cabal configure --disable-executable-dynamic --ghc-option=-optl=-static --ghc-option=-optl=-pthread --ghc-option=-optl=-L/usr/lib
$ cabal build
```

The difference is the extra options passed to the linker. After the last
command, I get a whole bunch of warnings about 
```
"Using '<function>' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking"
```

but these don't seem to cause any issues in practice. You can confirm that the
executable has been statically linked by running

```bash
$ ldd dist/build/blank-me-up/blank-me-up
        not a dynamic executable
```

I've made this project available
[here](https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/experiments/tree/master/static-haskell-nix)
if you'd like to tweak it. Since this was relatively straightforward, I think
it might be possible to do this without `buildFHSUserEnv`. Maybe I will try
that next.

Happy static linking!
