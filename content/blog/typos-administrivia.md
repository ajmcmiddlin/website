Title: Pulls I Have Requested

Why contribute to open source by making pull requests? For me it comes down to
two things:

1. I want this change made.
2. I want to be the one to make this change.

The first one is easier to talk about: I want the software to be better than it
is, for my own definition of 'better', and I think this change will make it so.
The second motivation is baser and possibly less noble, but no less important.
I get warm fuzzies and a sense of personal importance and fulfillment from
seeing my name in a commit message. If I wanted a change made but wasn't
especially interested in making that change myself, I might choose to do
nothing and wait or complain on the issue tracker until someone else does
something about it. This is irritating at best and actively harmful to a
maintainer's mental health at worst. Your motivations may be completely
different from mine, and I don't think it really matters, as long as the end
result is better software.

So what does it mean to contribute? I've come up with a personal taxonomy of
pull request types that I'd love to share with you.
