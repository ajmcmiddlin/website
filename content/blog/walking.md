Title: Walking

So yesterday I took a walk to buy some groceries, and today I took another to
buy some clothes from Uniqlo (as good as everyone says) and watch a movie (Edge
of Tomorrow). This is pretty unremarkable, except that I did this... in
Jakarta! I didn't think it was possible. I could definitely get used to this.
